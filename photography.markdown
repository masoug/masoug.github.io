Around 2019 I have purchased my first digital SLR camera: [Nikon D3500](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d3500.html) I was inpired to take up photography after learning about computer vision and I wanted to learn more about the physical mechanisms under which cameras work. Furthermore, photography is an acessible creative outlet for me to explore various different settings, environments, and subjects while also giving me an excuse to travel around. To me, photography seems to be about capturing a moment that evokes some emotion or feeling, and I enjoy employing modern camera and photo editing technologies as a tool for expressing my observations and experiences.

I'm also interested in topics related to computational photography such as panoramas, high-dynamic-range (HDR) imagery, and astrophotography. I have been using [Hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) as my primary computational photography toolset. My blog has more information about my experiences with computational photography.
