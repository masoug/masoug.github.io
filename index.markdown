Hi! I am Sammy, a robotics software engineer at Overland AI. I'm interested in robotics software related to perception, computer vision, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), path planning, dynamics and controls. I also love to work hands-on with embedded system projects such as Arduino, BeagleBone, and Raspberry Pi.

My interests span mutiple disciplines, including photography and art. Checkout the top menu links for details!
